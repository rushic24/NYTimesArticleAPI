Description: nytimesarticlev2
        =================
        
        ``nytimesarticlev2`` is a fully-functional Python wrapper for the `New
        York Times Article Search
        API <https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json>`__.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        With pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install nytimesarticlev2
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        nytimesarticlev2 requires the
        ```requests`` <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests>`__ and
        ```setuptools`` <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`__ packages.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Simply import and initialize the API with your developer key:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> from nytimesarticlev2 import articleAPI
            >>> api = articleAPI("YourAPIKey")
        
        Then call the ``search`` function with your desired search
        parameters/values:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> articles = api.search(q="Obama", 
                                      fq={"headline": "Obama", 
                                          "source": ["Reuters", 
                                                     "AP", 
                                                     "The New York Times"]}, 
                                      begin_date="20161023", # this can also be an int
                                      facet_field=["source", "day_of_week"], 
                                      facet_filter=True)
        
        The search function returns a Python dictionary of the search results.
        
        You can specify multiple filters by using a dictionary::
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> fq = {"headline": "Obama", "source": ["Reuters", "AP", "The New York Times"]}
        
        And multiple values by using a list::
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> facet_field = ["source", "day_of_week"]
        
        More examples:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> articles = api.search(q="Obama")
        
            >>> articles = api.search(q="Obama", begin_date="20111231", page=2)

        Documentation <http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2>`__.
